1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,560
Give me a second I

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,360
I need to get my story straight

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,560
My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,560
My lover she's waiting for me just across the bar

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,200
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar, and

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,440
I know I gave it to you months ago

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,360
I know you're trying to forget

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,160
But between the drinks and subtle things

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,680
The holes in my apologies, you know

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,480
I'm trying hard to take it back

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,960
So if by the time the bar closes

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,400
And you feel like falling down

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,600
I'll carry you home

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,240
Tonight

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,160
We are young

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,920
So let's set the world on fire

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,280
We can burn brighter than the sun

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,200
Tonight

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,680
We are young

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,440
So let's set the world on fire

21
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,480
We can burn brighter than the sun

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,160
Now I know that I'm not

23
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,560
All that you got

24
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:18,080
I guess that I, I just thought

25
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:25,040
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,720
But our friends are back

27
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,800
So let's raise a toast

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,960
'Cause I found someone to carry me home

29
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,680
Tonight

30
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,560
We are young

31
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,400
So let's set the world on fire

32
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,480
We can burn brighter than the sun

33
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,840
Tonight

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,600
We are young

35
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,080
So let's set the world on fire

36
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,360
We can burn brighter than the sun

37
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,520
Carry me home tonight (Nananananana)

38
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:11,520
Just carry me home tonight (Nananananana)

39
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,320
Carry me home tonight (Nananananana)

40
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,520
Just carry me home tonight (Nananananana)

41
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,680
The moon is on my side (Nananananana)

42
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,200
I have no reason to run (Nananananana)

43
00:02:26,200 --> 00:03:18,040
So will someone come and carry me home tonight (Nananananana)

44
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,800
The angels never arrived (Nananananana)

45
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,200
But I can hear the choir (Nananananana)

46
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,760
So will someone come and carry me home (Nananananana)

47
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,320
Tonight

48
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,040
We are young

49
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,440
So let's set the world on fire

50
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,680
We can burn brighter than the sun

51
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,080
Tonight

52
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,680
We are young

53
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,080
So let's set the world on fire

54
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:55,680
We can burn brighter than the sun

55
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,760
So if by the time the bar closes

56
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,560
And you feel like falling down

57
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:12,240
I'll carry you home tonight
